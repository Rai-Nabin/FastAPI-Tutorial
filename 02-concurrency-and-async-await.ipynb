    "### Technical Details\n",
    "Recent versions of Python support writing asynchronous code through a concept called \"coroutines.\" Coroutines allow for non-blocking operations, meaning that while waiting for certain tasks (like I/O operations) to complete, other code can continue running."

    "**Asynchronous Code**\n",
    "- Asynchronous code allows a program to handle tasks that require waiting (e.g., for I/O operations) without blocking execution.\n",
    "- During waiting, the program can perform other tasks rather than doing nothing.\n",
    "- The program periodically checks if any of the waiting tasks have completed.\n",
    "- Once a task finishes (e.g., reading a file, receiving network data), the program processes it.\n",
    "- Common \"slow\" tasks include network operations, file I/O, and database queries.\n",
    "- These operations are \"I/O bound\" and can be performed asynchronously to improve efficiency.\n",
    "- Asynchronous programming avoids waiting idly for tasks to finish and allows the program to manage multiple tasks more effectively.\n",
    "- Synchronous (or sequential) programming executes tasks in a strict order, blocking until each task completes before moving on.\n"

    "- `await` can only be used inside functions defined with `async def`.\n",
    "- Functions defined with `async def` must be \"awaited\" and can only be called inside other `async def` functions.\n",
    "- This creates a circular dependency: how do you call the first `async` function?\n",
    "- With FastAPI, you don't need to worry about this because your path operation function handles it, and FastAPI manages the execution.\n",
    "- If you're using async/await outside of FastAPI, you can still implement it by ensuring that all async functions are called within other async functions."

    "- If you're transitioning from another async framework where using `def` for trivial compute-only functions provided a slight performance gain, this approach in FastAPI might have the opposite effect.\n",

    "- If a utility function is defined with `async def`, you should use `await` when calling it in your code.\n",
